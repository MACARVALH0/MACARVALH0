<br><br>

## My stack
> **Front-end**: JavaScript | TypeScript | C | C++ <br>

Most of my coding experience is in **front-end web development**, but I particularly enjoy working with **backend** and **native** development.<br>My goal is **to become an experienced backend developer** building fast and efficient code who is able to turn concepts into programs that can actually **influence people's experience for the better**.
